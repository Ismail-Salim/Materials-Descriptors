# Materials-Descriptors



This is an underdevelopment repository for the choice of descriptors for materials in data-driven modeling of chemical reactions.

Python codes will be uploaded for various descriptors used in materials.



Part 1: 00_Part1_Mendeleev_Elements_Properties.ipynb1D 

** Descriptors: As an example, for chemical elements, the Periodic Table-Based Descriptors (Elements Properties) can be extracted and used as descriptors.
* One code is to extract these properties using the "Mendeleev" Library according to the elements in the data point.


Part 2: Another code is to extract the "mat2vec embeddings" using the "megnet" library.
